										<p>“Why there is a small percentage of Black American females in College Swim”<br />
											Project presented at Student Conference for Research, Professional Activity and Creative Arts,<br />
											Utica University.<br />
										<p>I first began my research as a student athlete freshman in university, investigating causes as to why there are close to no Black females in competitive college swim. This research focused on the different reasons black women do not swim and the various backbones of hinderance that have shied them away from swimming pools, as well as societies impact in these causes. In a sport that has only 1% of almost 400,000 swimmers registered as African-American, I drew conclusion that reasons these women stay away from the pool are mostly related to racism and psychological interferences. Reasons such as afro curly hair, lack of representation, the banning of an afro hair effective swim cap and racist swim history are the main causes. I conducted surveys, interviews, read books, and did calculations to draw data. This data was again interpreted and analyzed, quantitative and qualitative results generated even clearer data. Results found were expressed in form of a research paper, public presentation, interviews, works of art, and an abstract to coincide my research. I also shared my personal experiences to academic audience as a black female swimmer in a predominantly white institution. I took additional time to gain a detailed understanding of the social-scientific background, purpose, and significance of my new research skills. </p></p>
	
                                        <p>Website development and python programming<br />
											<p>I designed a portfolio website, using HTML 5 with no prior knowledge of HTML coding. I was able to use ideas from different parts of the internet to write code and place it in Visual Code studio thus making my portfolio. I am also currently in the process of teaching myself python programming using Youtube and phone apps. After I feel efficient, I will begin to look into SQL programming and polish my Kali Linux knowledge with the aim of scripting.</p>
